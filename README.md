debt_snowball
=============

A portfolio project that allows a user to calculate debt reduction using a style made popular by Dave Ramsey.

A Ruby app based on the "Debt Snowball" debt reduction method made popular by Dave Ramsey. You pay the minimum payments on all debt and put any extra money toward the smallest debt. Once the smallest debt is paid off, you take the minimum payment from that debt and roll it over to your next smallest debt until you are debt free. After you input your debt, you can record the amount you paid, and see at-a-glance, your debt reduced.
